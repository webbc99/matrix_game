# matrix_game
Gaurav's holiday task

Run the game.rb file to start the program.
ruby game.rb

You will enter a height and width to create a matrix of 0, e.g.

0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0

You can then update sections of the matrix by entering the following: Update rows X to Y columns A to B with character Z

For example, given the above matrix, you could enter:

"Update rows 1 to 2 columns 3 to 4 with character Y"

And then entering:

"Show matrix"

Would output the following:

0 0 Y Y
0 0 Y Y
0 0 0 0

You can continue to update the matrix and check the output.

Note:
To update a single row or column, saying e.g. Update rows 1 to 1 is valid.
